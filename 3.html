  <h2>Trek</h2>

  <p>Ryan Howard is one of the smoothest,
    most stylish riders to swing a leg over a
     mountain bike. The Santa Cruz-area local
     honed his flow skills racing Sandhill Dual
     slaloms as a grom and is an integral part
      of the original Post Office jumps crew.
      He has been sculpting and crafting trails
       for as long as he's been getting his bike
        in the sky. Dan Severson caught up with
        Ryan to check out his current quiver of
        Trek bikes, including a Rail e-bike. R-Dog
         has been with Trek for over 10 years now,
          and shredding with the C3 Project, he has
           some unique bikes to investigate.
